Installation:
1. Place the "VTProp" folder from the download into "KSP/Gamedata".
2. You no longer need to add "Liquidfuel.cfg" to use stock fuels. ModuleManager configs automatically set the fuel type.
3. If you want stock-scale engines, add "Rescale.cfg" to "KSP/GameData/VTProp".

Firespitter.dll is required. AJE is also required.
